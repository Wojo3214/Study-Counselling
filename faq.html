					<h2>Degree programmes at Business Academy Aarhus:</h2>

					<p>At Business Academy Aarhus we have three types of degree programmes taught in English -
						Academy Profession degrees (AP), Bachelor's degree programmes and Bachelor's top-up
						degree programmes. All of our degree programmes are recognised by the Danish Ministry of
						Education. They are also internationally recognised by the European Credit Transfer System
						(ECTS).
					</p>
					<h2>Academy Profession (AP) degree programmes:</h2>

					<p>An Academy Profession (AP) degree is an undergraduate academic degree. This
						comprehensive 2-2½ year programme is similar to the first two years of a Bachelor degree
						and awards 120 ECTS.
					</p>
					<h2>Bachelor's programmes:</h2>

					<p>A full Bachelor's degree programme lasts for 3½ years. You will be awarded 210 ECTS when
						you graduate and if you don't want to start working straight away, you can continue your
						studies in Denmark or abroad to get a Master's degree.
					</p>
					<h2>Bachelor's top-up programmes:</h2>

					<p>Once you have completed your AP degree, you can take another 1½ years of full-time
						studies and be awarded 90 ECTS. Your AP degree programme combined with the
						Bachelor's top-up programme is equivalent to a full Bachelor's degree.
					</p>
					<h2>More Information
					</h2>

					<p>On our individual programme pages, you can read about the entrance requirements and how
						to get accepted into Business Academy Aarhus. You can find all the information about the
						documents we need from you to process an application, and you can also find the application
						information and deadlines etc.

					<h2>Prepare for the future with your internship</h2>

					<p>As a student at Business Academy Aarhus, you will take part in a compulsory internship
						where you will be able to use your knowledge in practice. This 2-10 month internship
						(typically 3-5 months) will give you a chance to experience:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Relevant real-life learning in a company</li>
						<li>Networking and experience that may lead to a future job</li>
						<li>Working in an international company</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Each year Business Academy Aarhus cooperates with more than 800 companies in
						Denmark and abroad, for example, Carlsberg, Ikea, Nordea Bank, Novo Nordisk and
						Porsche USA.</p>

					<h2>Housing for full degree students</h2>

					<p>You must apply for housing as soon as you have decided to study in Aarhus – before you
						receive your admission letter.</p>
					<p>Business Academy Aarhus is unfortunately not able to offer housing as we do not have any
						dormitories. However, you can apply for housing via Student Housing Aarhus, which
						administers residences for students across Aarhus.</p>

					<h2>How to apply for housing </h2>

					<p>At studenthousingaarhus.com you will find instructions in English on how to apply for a room,
						as well as a list of dormitories. These are listed according to town areas and room types
						(single, couple, couple with children).
						</p>
					<p>You should apply long before you get to Aarhus - the demand is extremely high and the
						number of places is limited. The waiting times are also usually long, but most students are
						able to find housing through Student Housing Aarhus if they apply early enough. You can
						apply up to 6 months before the study start.</p>
					<p>Please note that your application has to be renewed each month.</p>

					<h2>Housing guarantee</h2>

					<p>All new international students moving to Aarhus for the autumn semester are guaranteed
						housing. </p>

					<h2>Other long-term housing</h2>

					<p>There is also a possibility of renting a room or a flat on your own.</p>

					<h2>Short-term housing</h2>

					<p>If your long-term housing is not available when you arrive in Aarhus, there are several
						options for short-term stays. Please note, however, that these are rather expensive
						compared to the monthly rent of a student dormitory room.</p>

					<h2>Do you need any help?</h2>

					<p>The best advice you can probably get is from our current students, so we would advise
						joining the international facebook group or chatting directly with our ambassadors.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions you can also write to us at <a href="mailto:apply@baaa.dk">apply@baaa.dk</a>.</p>
